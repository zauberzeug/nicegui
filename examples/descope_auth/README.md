# Descope Auth Example

Descope is an all-inclusive user authentication and user management platform.

## Getting Started

1. Create a [Descope](https://www.descope.com/) account.
2. Setup a project and configure the "Login Flow" (first step in the Getting Started Wizard).
3. Instead of following the "Integrate" instructions of the Wizard, use this example.
4. Provide your Descope Project ID as environment variable: `DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id> python3 main.py`
