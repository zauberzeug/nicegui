@doc.demo('Storage', '''
    NiceGUI offers a straightforward mechanism for data persistence within your application.
    It features five built-in storage types:

    - `app.storage.tab`:
        Stored server-side in memory, this dictionary is unique to each tab session and can hold arbitrary objects.
        Data will be lost when restarting the server until <https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/discussions/2841> is implemented.
        This storage is only available within [page builder functions](/documentation/page)
        and requires an established connection, obtainable via [`await client.connected()`](/documentation/page#wait_for_client_connection).
    - `app.storage.client`:
        Also stored server-side in memory, this dictionary is unique to each client connection and can hold arbitrary objects.
        Data will be discarded when the page is reloaded or the user navigates to another page.
        Unlike data stored in `app.storage.tab` which can be persisted on the server even for days,
        `app.storage.client` helps caching resource-hungry objects such as a streaming or database connection you need to keep alive
        for dynamic site updates but would like to discard as soon as the user leaves the page or closes the browser.
        This storage is only available within [page builder functions](/documentation/page).
    - `app.storage.user`:
        Stored server-side, each dictionary is associated with a unique identifier held in a browser session cookie.
        Unique to each user, this storage is accessible across all their browser tabs.
        `app.storage.browser['id']` is used to identify the user.
    - `app.storage.general`:
        Also stored server-side, this dictionary provides a shared storage space accessible to all users.
    - `app.storage.browser`:
        Unlike the previous types, this dictionary is stored directly as the browser session cookie, shared among all browser tabs for the same user.
        However, `app.storage.user` is generally preferred due to its advantages in reducing data payload, enhancing security, and offering larger storage capacity.
        By default, NiceGUI holds a unique identifier for the browser session in `app.storage.browser['id']`.

    The user storage and browser storage are only available within `page builder functions </documentation/page>`_
    because they are accessing the underlying `Request` object from FastAPI.
    Additionally these two types require the `storage_secret` parameter in`ui.run()` to encrypt the browser session cookie.

    | Storage type                | `tab`  | `client` | `user` | `general` | `browser` |
    |-----------------------------|--------|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|
    | Location                    | Server | Server   | Server | Server    | Browser   |

    | Across browsers             | No     | No       | No     | Yes       | No        |
    | Across server restarts      | No     | No       | No     | Yes       | No        |
    | Across page reloads         | Yes    | No       | Yes    | Yes       | Yes       |
    | Needs page builder function | Yes    | Yes      | Yes    | No        | Yes       |
    | Needs client connection     | Yes    | No       | No     | No        | No        |
    | Write only before response  | No     | No       | No     | No        | Yes       |
    | Needs serializable data     | No     | No       | Yes    | Yes       | Yes       |

@doc.demo('Storing data per browser tab', '''
    When storing data in `app.storage.tab`, a single user can open multiple tabs of the same app, each with its own storage data.
    This may be beneficial in certain scenarios like search or when performing data analysis.
    It is also more secure to use such a volatile storage for scenarios like logging into a bank account or accessing a password manager.

@doc.demo('Short-term memory', '''
    The goal of `app.storage.client` is to store data only for the duration of the current page visit.
    In difference to data stored in `app.storage.tab`
    - which is persisted between page changes and even browser restarts as long as the tab is kept open -
    the data in `app.storage.client` will be discarded if the user closes the browser, reloads the page or navigates to another page.
    This is beneficial for resource-hungry, intentionally short-lived or sensitive data.
    An example is a database connection, which should be closed as soon as the user leaves the page.
    Additionally, this storage useful if you want to return a page with default settings every time a user reloads.
    Meanwhile, it keeps the data alive during in-page navigation.
    This is also helpful when updating elements on the site at intervals, such as a live feed.
