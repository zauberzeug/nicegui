# NiceGUI

NiceGUI is an easy-to-use, Python-based UI framework, which shows up in your web browser.
You can create buttons, dialogs, Markdown, 3D scenes, plots and much more.

It is great for micro web apps, dashboards, robotics projects, smart home solutions and similar use cases.
You can also use it in development, for example when tweaking/configuring a machine learning algorithm or tuning motor controllers.

NiceGUI is available as [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/nicegui/), [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/zauberzeug/nicegui) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui).

  - get steering events via virtual joysticks
  - annotate and overlay images
  - interact with tables
  - navigate foldable tree structures
- built-in timer to refresh data in intervals (even every 10 ms)
- straight-forward data binding to write even less code

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install nicegui
```

## Usage

Write your nice GUI in a file `main.py`:

```python
from nicegui import ui

ui.label('Hello NiceGUI!')
ui.button('BUTTON', on_click=lambda: ui.notify('button was pressed'))

ui.run()
```

Launch it with:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The GUI is now available through http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
Note: NiceGUI will automatically reload the page when you modify the code.

## Documentation and Examples

The API reference is hosted at [https://nicegui.io/reference](https://nicegui.io/reference) and provides plenty of live examples.
The whole content of [https://nicegui.io](https://nicegui.io) is [implemented with NiceGUI itself](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/blob/main/main.py).

You may also have a look at [our in-depth demonstrations](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/tree/main/examples) of what you can do with NiceGUI.

## Why?

We at [Zauberzeug](https://zauberzeug.com) like [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
but find it does [too much magic](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/issues/1#issuecomment-847413651) when it comes to state handling.
In search for an alternative nice library to write simple graphical user interfaces in Python we discovered [JustPy](https://justpy.io/).
Although we liked the approach, it is too "low-level HTML" for our daily usage.
But it inspired us to use [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) for the frontend.

We have built on top of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/),
which itself is based on the ASGI framework [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/)
and the ASGI webserver [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)
because of their great performance and ease of use.
