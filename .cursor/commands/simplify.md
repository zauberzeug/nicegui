description: Suggest ways to simplify the current code
---

Ensure you understand the project by reading README.md, AGENTS.md, and CONTRIBUTING.md,
then review the current code and suggest simplifications.

Look for:

- Unnecessary complexity
- Code duplication
- Over-abstraction
- Opportunities to use standard patterns
- Blocking operations that should be async

Propose concrete, simpler alternatives adhering to the principles in AGENTS.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.
