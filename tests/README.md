# Automated Tests for NiceGUI

## Motivation

Testing a user interface is hard work.
But to ensure NiceGUI is working as expected it is of utmost importance.
Even if automated testing needs a lot of infrastructure and results in long execution times, we believe that it's worth the effort when compared to manual testing.

## Setup

Please be aware that the below commands installs the latest version of the ChromeDriver binary, which is compatible with the version of Google Chrome installed on your system.
If you have a different version of Chrome installed, you may need to install a different version of ChromeDriver or update your Chrome installation to be compatible with the installed ChromeDriver version.

### Mac

```bash
cd nicegui # enter the project root dir
brew install cask chromedriver
python3 -m pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

Note: The above instructions assume that you have already installed Homebrew (a package manager for macOS) on your system.
If you haven't, you can follow the instructions on https://brew.sh/ to install it.

### Windows

```powershell
cd nicegui # enter the project root dir
choco install chromedriver
python3 -m pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

Note: The above instructions assume that you have already installed Chocolatey (a package manager for Windows) on your system.
If you haven't, you can follow the instructions on https://chocolatey.org/install to install it.

### Linux

```bash
cd nicegui # enter the project root dir
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install chromium-chromedriver
python3 -m pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
```

Note: The above instructions assume that you are using a Debian-based Linux distribution.
If you are using a different distribution, the package manager and package names may differ.
Please refer to the documentation for your distribution for more information.

## Usage

Because selenium queries are quite cumbersome and lengthily, we introduced a `Screen` class.
This provides a high-level interface to work with the currently displayed state of the web browser.
The workflow is as follows:

1. get the screen fixture by providing `screen: Screen` as an argument to the function
2. write your NiceGUI code inside the function
3. use `screen.open(...)` with the appropriate url path to start querying the website
4. for example use `screen.should_contain(...)` with some text as parameter to ensure that the text is shown

Here is a very simple example:

```py
from nicegui import ui
from .screen import Screen

def test_hello_world(screen: Screen):
    ui.label('Hello, world')

    screen.open('/')
    screen.should_contain('Hello, world')
```

Have a look at the existing tests for more examples.
Internally we use selenium-fixture (see `conftest.py`).
To access the webdriver directly you can use the `screen.selenium` property.
Have a look at https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/getting-started.html for documentation of the available method calls to the webdriver.
