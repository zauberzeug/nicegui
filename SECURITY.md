# Security Policy

Security is very important for NiceGUI and its community. 🔒

Learn more about it below. 👇

## Versions

The latest version of NiceGUI is supported.

You are encouraged to write tests for your application and update your NiceGUI version frequently after ensuring that your tests are passing.
This way you will benefit from the latest features, bug fixes, and **security fixes**.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away
by creating a private security advisory (GitHub → Security → Report a vulnerability)
so we can discuss and patch the issue in a secure workspace.
If you cannot use GitHub, you can also send an email to: nicegui@zauberzeug.com.

Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

We (the team at Zauberzeug) will review it thoroughly and get back to you.

## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability. 🙊

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
